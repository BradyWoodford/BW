Version Control: Talking about the project as a whole (website - logos, images, documentation, code)

Source Control: Talking purely about the developmental aspect of the application (just the code)
Example: clone existing versions (copy) of a repository in order to work on the same application (multiple peers); allows one to revert to a previous version in the event of a bug/crash
